#---------------------------------------------------------------#
#------------------GENERAL CONFIGURATIONS-----------------------#
#---------------------------------------------------------------#
# These configs are used by underlying DSpace API, and are      #
# therefore applicable to all interfaces                        #
#---------------------------------------------------------------#
##### Basic information ######

# DSpace installation directory
dspace.dir = /home/dspace/dspace_i

# DSpace host name - should match base URL.  Do not include port number
dspace.hostname = localhost

# DSpace base host URL.  Include port number etc.
dspace.baseUrl = http://localhost:8080

# DSpace base URL.  Include port number etc., but NOT trailing slash
# Change to xmlui if you wish to use the xmlui as the default, or remove
# "/jspui" and set webapp of your choice as the "ROOT" webapp in
# the servlet engine.
dspace.url = ${dspace.baseUrl}/xmlui

# Name of the site
dspace.name = DSpace FDV 

##### Database settings #####

# Database name ("oracle", or "postgres")
#db.name = postgres
db.name = postgres
#db.name = oracle

# URL for connecting to database
#db.url = jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/dspace
db.url = jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/dspace

# JDBC Driver
#db.driver = org.postgresql.Driver
db.driver = org.postgresql.Driver

# Database username and password
#db.username = dspace
#db.password = dspace
db.username = dspace
db.password = D3pace012

# Schema name - if your database contains multiple schemas, you can avoid problems with
# retrieving the definitions of duplicate object names by specifying
# the schema name here that is used for DSpace by uncommenting the following entry
# db.schema =

# Connection pool parameters

# Maximum number of DB connections in pool
db.maxconnections = 30

# Maximum time to wait before giving up if all connections in pool are busy (milliseconds)
db.maxwait = 5000

# Maximum number of idle connections in pool (-1 = unlimited)
db.maxidle = -1

# Determine if prepared statement should be cached. (default is true)
db.statementpool = true

# Specify a name for the connection pool (useful if you have multiple applications sharing Tomcat's dbcp)
# If not specified, defaults to 'dspacepool'
# db.poolname = dspacepool

##### Email settings ######

# SMTP mail server
mail.server = mail.arvo.es

# SMTP mail server authentication username and password (if required)
mail.server.username = arvo@arvo.es
mail.server.password = arvo007

# SMTP mail server alternate port (defaults to 25)
mail.server.port = 25

# From address for mail
mail.from.address = arvo@arvo.es

# Currently limited to one recipient!
feedback.recipient = arvo@arvo.es

# General site administration (Webmaster) e-mail
mail.admin = arvo@arvo.es

# Recipient for server errors and alerts
# alert.recipient = email-address-here

# Recipient for new user registration emails
# registration.notify = email-address-here

# Set the default mail character set. This may be over ridden by providing a line
# inside the email template "charset: <encoding>", otherwise this default is used.
mail.charset = UTF-8

# A comma separated list of hostnames that are allowed to refer browsers to email forms.
# Default behaviour is to accept referrals only from dspace.hostname
#mail.allowed.referrers = localhost

# Pass extra settings to the Java mail library. Comma separated, equals sign between
# the key and the value.
#mail.extraproperties = mail.smtp.socketFactory.port=465, \
#                       mail.smtp.socketFactory.class=javax.net.ssl.SSLSocketFactory, \
#                       mail.smtp.socketFactory.fallback=false

# An option is added to disable the mailserver. By default, this property is set to false
# By setting mail.server.disabled = true, DSpace will not send out emails.
# It will instead log the subject of the email which should have been sent
# This is especially useful for development and test environments where production data is used when testing functionality.
#mail.server.disabled = false

# Default language for metadata values
default.language = spa


##### File Storage ######

# Asset (bitstream) store number 0 (zero)
assetstore.dir = ${dspace.dir}/assetstore

# Specify extra asset stores like this, counting from 1 upwards:
# assetstore.dir.1 = /second/assetstore
# assetstore.dir.2 = /third/assetstore

# Specify the number of the store to use for new bitstreams with this property
# The default is 0 (zero) which corresponds to the 'assetstore.dir' above
# assetstore.incoming = 1


##### SRB File Storage #####

# The same 'assetstore.incoming' property is used to support the use of SRB
# (Storage Resource Broker - see http://www.sdsc.edu/srb/) as an _optional_
# replacement of or supplement to conventional file storage. DSpace will work
# with or without SRB and full backward compatibility is maintained.
#
# The 'assetstore.incoming' property is an integer that references where _new_
# bitstreams will be stored.  The default (say the starting reference) is zero.
# The value will be used to identify the storage where all new bitstreams will
# be stored until this number is changed.  This number is stored in the
# Bitstream table (store_number column) in the DSpace database, so older
# bitstreams that may have been stored when 'asset.incoming' had a different
# value can be found.
#
# In the simple case in which DSpace uses local (or mounted) storage the
# number can refer to different directories (or partitions).  This gives DSpace
# some level of scalability.  The number links to another set of properties
# 'assetstore.dir', 'assetstore.dir.1' (remember zero is default),
# 'assetstore.dir.2', etc., where the values are directories.
#
# To support the use of SRB DSpace uses this same scheme but broadened to
# support:
# - using SRB instead of the local filesystem
# - using the local filesystem (native DSpace)
# - using a mix of SRB and local filesystem
#
# In this broadened use the 'asset.incoming' integer will refer one of the
# following storage locations
# - a local filesystem directory (native DSpace)
# - a set of SRB account parameters (host, port, zone, domain, username,
#       password, home directory, and resource)
#
# Should the be any conflict, like '2' refering to a local directory and
# to a set of SRB parameters, the program will select the local directory.
#
# If SRB is chosen from the first install of DSpace, it is suggested that
# 'assetstore.dir' (no integer appended) be retained to reference a local
# directory (as above under File Storage) because build.xml uses this value
# to do a mkdir. In this case, 'assetstore.incoming' can be set to 1 (i.e.
# uncomment the line in File Storage above) and the 'assetstore.dir' will not
# be used.
#
# Here is an example set of SRB parameters:
# Assetstore 1 - SRB
#srb.host.1 = mysrbmcathost.myu.edu
#srb.port.1 = 5544
#srb.mcatzone.1 = mysrbzone
#srb.mdasdomainname.1 = mysrbdomain
#srb.defaultstorageresource.1 = mydefaultsrbresource
#srb.username.1 = mysrbuser
#srb.password.1 = mysrbpassword
#srb.homedirectory.1 = /mysrbzone/home/mysrbuser.mysrbdomain
#srb.parentdir.1 = mysrbdspaceassetstore
#
# Assetstore n, n+1, ...
# Follow same pattern as for assetstores above (local or SRB)


##### Logging configuration #####

# Override default log4j configuration
# you may provide your own configuration here, existing
# alternatives are:
# log.init.config = ${dspace.dir}/config/log4j.xml
# log.init.config = ${dspace.dir}/config/log4j-console.properties

log.init.config = ${dspace.dir}/config/log4j.properties

# Where to put the logs (used in configuration only)
log.dir = ${dspace.dir}/log

# If enabled, the logging and the solr statistics system will look for
# an X-Forward header. If it finds it, it will use this for the user IP Address
# useProxies = true


##### Search settings #####

# Where to put search index files
search.dir = ${dspace.dir}/search

# Higher values of search.max-clauses will enable prefix searches to work on
# large repositories
# search.max-clauses = 2048

# Which Lucene Analyzer implementation to use.  If this is omitted or
# commented out, the standard DSpace analyzer (designed for English)
# is used by default.
# search.analyzer = org.dspace.search.DSAnalyzer

# Non-Stemming analyzer.  Does not "stem" words/terms. When using this analyzer,
# a search for "wellness" will always return items matching "wellness" and not "well".
# However, similarly a search for "experiments" will only return objects matching 
# "experiments" and not "experiment" or "experimenting".
# search.analyzer = org.dspace.search.DSNonStemmingAnalyzer

# Chinese analyzer
# search.analyzer = org.apache.lucene.analysis.cn.ChineseAnalyzer

# Boolean search operator to use, current supported values are OR and AND
# If this config item is missing or commented out, OR is used
# AND requires all search terms to be present
# OR requires one or more search terms to be present
search.operator = OR


##### Search indexing settings #####

# Maximum number of terms indexed for a single field in Lucene.
# Default is 10,000 words - often not enough for full-text indexing.
# If you change this, you'll need to re-index for the change
# to take effect on previously added items.
# -1 = unlimited (Integer.MAX_VALUE)
search.maxfieldlength = 10000


##### Fields to Index for Search #####

# DC metadata elements.qualifiers to be indexed for search
# format: - search.index.[number] = [search field]:element.qualifier
#         - * used as wildcard

###      changing these will change your search results,     ###
###  but will NOT automatically change your search displays  ###

search.index.1 = author:dc.contributor.*
search.index.2 = author:dc.creator.*
search.index.3 = title:dc.title.*
search.index.4 = keyword:dc.subject.*
search.index.5 = abstract:dc.description.abstract
search.index.6 = author:dc.description.statementofresponsibility
#search.index.7 = series:dc.relation.ispartofseries
search.index.7 = abstract:dc.description.tableofcontents
#search.index.9 = mime:dc.format.mimetype
#search.index.10 = sponsor:dc.description.sponsorship
search.index.8 = identifier:dc.identifier.*
search.index.9 = language:dc.language.iso



##### Handle settings ######

# Canonical Handle URL prefix
#
# By default, DSpace is configured to use http://hdl.handle.net/
# as the canonical URL prefix when generating dc.identifier.uri
# during submission, and in the 'identifier' displayed in JSPUI
# item record pages.
#
# If you do not subscribe to CNRI's handle service, you can change this
# to match the persistent URL service you use, or you can force DSpace
# to use your site's URL, eg.
#handle.canonical.prefix = ${dspace.url}/handle/
#
# Note that this will not alter dc.identifer.uri metadata for existing
# items (only for subsequent submissions), but it will alter the URL 
# in JSPUI's 'identifier' message on item record pages for existing items.
#
# If omitted, the canonical URL prefix will be http://hdl.handle.net/
handle.canonical.prefix = http://hdl.handle.net/

# CNRI Handle prefix
handle.prefix = 10641

# Directory for installing Handle server files
handle.dir = ${dspace.dir}/handle-server

# By default RSS feeds, OAI-PMH and subscription emails will include ALL items
# regardless of permissions set on them.

# user is granted READ permission, then set the following options to false
#
# Warning: In large repositories, setting harvest.includerestricted.oai to false may cause
